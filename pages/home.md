AI-Care (Artifcial Intelligence for treating cancer therapy resistance), a newly funded Carl-Zeiss-Stiftung project, is pioneering the application of artificial intelligence to combat cancer therapy resistance. Through a collaborative effort between RPTU, DKFZ, and the University of Heidelberg. The project seeks to decipher the mechanisms underlying cancer cell adaptability and develop tailored treatment approaches to overcome resistance.
