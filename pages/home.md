AI-Care (Artifcial Intelligence for treating cancer therapy resistance), a newly funded Carl-Zeiss-Stiftung project, is pioneering the application of artificial intelligence to combat cancer therapy resistance. Through a collaborative effort between Rhineland-Pfalz Technical University (RPTU), German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), and the University of Heidelberg. The project seeks to decipher the mechanisms underlying cancer cell phenotypic plasticity and develop tailored treatment approaches to overcome therapy resistance.
